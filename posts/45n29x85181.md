[ReadingNote] [978-0471625469] pg47 In his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, written at age 24, Gauss introduced the theory of congruences, which gained ready acceptance as a fundamental tool for the study of number theory. Some fundamental ideas of congruences are included in this first section. The theorems of Fermat and Euler are especially noteworthy, providing powerful techniques for analyzing the multiplicative aspects of congruences. These two pioneers in number theory worked in widely contrasting ways. Mathematics was an avocation for Fermat, who was a lawyer by profession. He communicated his mathematical ideas by corre- spondence with other mathematicians, giving very few details of the proofs of his assertions. (One of his claims is known as Fermat's "last theorem," although it is not a theorem at all as yet, having never been proved. This situation is discussed in Section 5.4.) Leonard Euler (1707 -1783), on the other hand, wrote prolifically in almost all the known branches of mathematics of his time.
